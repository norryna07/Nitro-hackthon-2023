## General information
This project was create by the team 'medontknow' in [Nitro hackthon 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nitro-language-processing-2/overview). 
We are 2 students in first year at FMI, University of Bucharest, that learn machine leaning just for this contest.
We ranked 28th out of 75 teams initially registered, a very good position taking into account the fact that the master's students for whom this subject was well-known also competed.
